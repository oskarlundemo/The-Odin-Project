## Overview
A brief description of what the project does and why it was created.
This was a project in The Odin Project curriculum which is a teachning plattform I am working
through to brush up my skills and have fun! ü§©

## What I Learned
- New concepts or technologies explored
Asynchronous programming with async and await. I understand the explanation of it from the curriculum
or other sources of knowledge, that you send a promise that will be fulfilled or rejected, but I
am still struggling a bit to implement I think. Which might be obvious to someone with more
to be able to see. ü§ì

- Challenges faced and how they were solved
Whether or not the conversion between Celsius or Fahrenheit should have been done on the client side
or the server side. I went with the client side since I thought that it would suffice for a project of this
scale and since I did not want to wait for pending API requests ‚è±Ô∏è


## Code Structure
- Explanation of code organization
I feel like I am still trying to get a grip on better modularisation of my code. For instance I took the
data from the API and created a new object called "Forecast" which parsed the info that I needed and left
the rest.

- Any parts of the code you're particularly proud of
I would say some functions in the dom.js file that uses arrow functions or ternary operators ex ? -1 : 1. I
think that by trying to always rewrite the code with theses in mind I could produce cleaner and more
readable code. üòé

## Future Plans
- Features or improvements you‚Äôd like to add
There were a TON of data from the API so ofcourse I could have built on this project forever. However, I personally
feel that the most important knowledge I have gained is from using API:s and starting to understand and implementing
asynchronous code üßë‚Äçüíª

## Reflection
- What you‚Äôd do differently next time
I probably would have set a color theme from the get-go and not worried about it going forward. I feel
like should also start using HUE instead of hex for my root-variables üé®

- Skills or concepts you want to learn next
Hmm... I think I would really like to deep dive into API:s and just expand on that knowledge since I feel
that binding several togheter could really create som unique projects. And right now I am just overwhelmed with
the thought of how that asynchronous code would work? Data from one API waiting from another API?? üôÄ
