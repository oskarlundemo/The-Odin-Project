# Project Title

## Overview
A brief description of what the project does and why it was created.
This is a basic todo website that was apart of the Odin Project

## What I Learned
- New concepts or technologies explored
Modularisation and trying to divide my code into smaller independant pieces. That togheter make the
system work. Example of TodoList objects containg todos.

- Challenges faced and how they were solved
Adding and removing elements dynamically from the DOM. I solved this issue by adding a small
delay timer which gave the elements extra time to apply the transtion specified in the css.

Also trying to couple the elements with the datastructure. Right now I binded them togheter with
the dataset attribute of the html-element. However I could see that this is not good practice since
this means information that should not be available is available through the "siteinpection-mode"


## Code Structure
- Explanation of code organization
I have to admit that I really only thought about the structure more critically for the objects
Project, TodoList and Tod o and the rest is kinda on the fly. So it does not supports me that some
functions in the dom.js file should be independent or placed in their own separate file.

- Any parts of the code you're particularly proud of
The strucuture of Projects which holds all the TodoLists which in return holds all the todos
relating to each project.

## Future Plans
- Features or improvements you’d like to add
There are definitely some styling fixes and details that could be fixed. I know there are no
good excuses, but since I now I could fix theses issuses I would rather begina a more challening
project and widening my skills.

## Reflection
- What you’d do differently next time
Work more in the console before adding the HTML-elements to the mix. This made it take way
longer time since I debugged with elements instead of just making the logic work in the console
and afterward implement it in the DOM.

- Skills or concepts you want to learn next
Definitely more advanced CSS, to make it more appealing and user-friendly. I feel like that is something
really crucial to create a nice website. And course learn more about design principles to structure my code better.
