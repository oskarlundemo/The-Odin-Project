# 📚 The Odin Project — Monorepo
This repository is a personal monorepo documenting my journey through The Odin Project — a full-stack web development curriculum that has guided me through modern frontend and backend technologies, project-based learning, and real-world development skills.

I’ve used this monorepo to organize all the lessons, projects, and custom work I’ve completed along the way, especially through the intermediate to advanced sections of the curriculum.

## 🌐 Intermediate HTML and CSS
I developed a strong foundation in semantic HTML and modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid. I also learned the importance of responsive design, accessibility, and clean, maintainable structure—all critical for building user-friendly interfaces.

## 💻 JavaScript
This section deepened my understanding of vanilla JavaScript, focusing on key concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, ES6+ syntax, functions, objects, and asynchronous programming with Promises and fetch. I also built several projects that strengthened my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎨 Advanced HTML and CSS
Here, I focused on advanced CSS topics like animations, transitions, custom properties (CSS variables), and responsive typography. I also practiced creating fully responsive and polished UIs that mimic real-world websites.

## ⚛️ React
I learned how to build component-based user interfaces using React, manage state with hooks like useState and useEffect, and implement routing using React Router. This section also introduced props drilling, lifting state up, and performance-conscious practices like memoization. I applied these skills in full projects, including a complex social app.

## 🗄️ Databases
This part introduced me to relational databases using PostgreSQL, including how to design schema, manage relationships, and write SQL queries. I also connected databases to Node.js applications and used ORMs like Prisma for efficient data handling.

## 🔧 Node.js
I learned how to build backend services using Node.js and Express, create RESTful APIs, handle routing and middleware, and connect to databases. I also explored topics like authentication, file uploads, and structuring scalable server-side applications.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned
Through this structured learning path, I’ve gained hands-on experience with:

Frontend: Semantic HTML, responsive CSS (Flexbox/Grid), accessibility, and modern JavaScript (ES6+)

Advanced UI: React, component-based architecture, state management, routing, and performance optimization

Backend: Node.js, Express, and REST APIs

Databases: Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL

## 🛠️ Structure
This monorepo is organized by topic/module with each folder containing:

Project source code

Notes and references

Any extra custom features I’ve added

## 🚀 Final Goal
To build a professional-grade full-stack portfolio with real-world apps—like Blixt (Instagram Clone)—and prepare for job readiness with modern, production-ready code.
