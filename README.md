# 📚 The Odin Project — Monorepo
This repository is a personal monorepo documenting my journey through The Odin Project — a full-stack web development curriculum that has guided me through modern frontend and backend technologies, project-based learning, and real-world development skills.

I’ve used this monorepo to organize all the lessons, projects, and custom work I’ve completed along the way, especially through the intermediate to advanced sections of the curriculum.

Backend: Node.js, Express, and REST APIs

Databases: Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL

🚀 Final Goal
To build a professional-grade full-stack portfolio with real-world apps—like Blixt (Instagram Clone)—and prepare for job readiness with modern, production-ready code.
