NOTE: This project was created following this tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&ab_channel=TechWithTim"
Therefore I cannot claim to have code the backbone of this application and can only really take credit for the design.

To run this application, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.'
